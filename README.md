This repository contains materials employed in our work to segment subcortical brain structures by employing a 3D fully Convolutional Neural Network.

The article related is entitled: "3D fully convolutional networks for subcortical segmentation in MRI: A large-scale study" and it has been submitted to the journal of NeuroImage (2nd,Nov,2016) for publication.

If either segmentation labels or probability maps generated in this large-scale study are used, please cite this work: (Exactly citation coming soon).
